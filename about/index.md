You might be wondering where our name comes from, and it comes from the [Oort Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud). We see edge computing as the next frontier and outer boundary of cloud. Cloud Computing as we know has remained within the "[heliosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere)" or datacenter, we want to extend it outside the datacenter. Objects in the Oort Cloud are tiny and numerous compared to planets, edge hardware is often tiny and numerous compared to traditional data center hardware.
